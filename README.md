# Qt Tablet Tester

This project aims to create a comprehensive application for testing and debugging graphic tablet support in the Qt application framework.

## Features

Qt Tablet Tester (QtTT) will be able to:
- Display all avaliable properties provided by graphics tablets (position, pressure, tilt, rotation, and more) in a way that is simple and intuitive enough to be used by non-developers that are just interested in testing their tablets.
- Guide non-technical users in producing comprehensive reports of the tablet's specifications and Qt's support for the tablet on multiple different versions that can help developers of other Qt-based applications in debugging graphics tablet issues.
- Create logs of tablet mouse and touch events that can be easily be used by developers to emulate the users input in their own application and replicate user tablet compabibility issues without the need to actually possess the user's hardware.

Currently the application is still under development and not all of these features have been implemented yet. However they are all in the works and will hopefully be implemented within the coming months.

## Contributing

Community contributions are welcome, but it is recommended you create a discussion on the relevant issue before starting to make any large changes to the program so that it can be integrated into our project with as little difficulty as possible. A PR will suffice for small changes, bugfixes, and translations.
